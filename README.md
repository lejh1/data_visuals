# data_visuals
This is the start of some side projects regarding data visualizations with Python. This is to help me develop my self taught Data Science/Analyst skills to work with data using Python (pandas, numpy, seaborm, matplotlib, etc). Inspired by aaronpenne who helped introduce me to the world of data science.

First Letter of Baby Names from 1917 - 2017 (100 Years) - US
----------------
Interesting heatmap displaying the change over 100 years of the first letter of baby names. Each year is scaled where the max of each year is 1.0, I divided each letter count by the max of each year. Used Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib :)

1 Bedroom Apartment Monthly Rent Plots 2010 - 2018
----------------
Some visuals to show 1 Bedroom Apartment Monthly Rent from 2010 - 2018 in California per County.
Started 8/30 (first data visual project), needs lots of work to clean and update heat map with legend.
Also need to figure out how to make higher quality GIF and find better apartment listing dataset :( .
