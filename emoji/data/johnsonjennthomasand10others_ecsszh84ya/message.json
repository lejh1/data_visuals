I just want to remind you guys that you should please fill out the google form listed along with the BDC questionnaire on the BDC facebook page. It's easier for me to keep track and makes my job less stressful. Lastly, have a nice winter break and enjoy the presence of relatives/friends! Please keep on the lookout for another possible questionnaire and designated roles. Thank you everyone! :)",
